Australia has fully vaccinated more than three-quarters of the population aged 16 and older.Taking into account the entire population, including vaccinated children, Australia has now pulled ahead of the US. More than 61.502per cent of the Australian population are now fully vaccinated, compared to 56.702per cent in the US.Australia's rate of delivery reached a peak of 1.15 daily doses per 100 people in late September, when the rollout had reached about 60 per cent of the total population. It has held steady since then, fluctuating02between 1.0 and 1.1402daily doses per 100 people.The data is in the02charts below, which track how the states and territories are progressing in the coronavirus vaccination rollout, as well as how Australia compares to the rest of the world.Both sets of numbers are updated daily, so bookmark this page to stay up-to-date.Skip to a section:Australia is now delivering one million doses every 3-4 days, compared with 45 days for the first one million doses, 20 days for the next million doses and 17 days for the third million total doses.Australia's vaccination program has picked up pace since local outbreaks in multiple states plunged millions into lockdown.The calculations assume a constant pace based on the02seven-day moving average for 1st doses plus the interval between doses in each jurisdiction until a week before the estimated date. Within a week of the date, the calculation uses the seven-day moving average for 2nd doses.According to the national roadmap, Australia will move to the next phase of opening up when 70 per cent of the02population aged 16 and older have had two doses of vaccine. This is the equivalent of 56.2 per cent of the total population.The third phase will come into force when 80 per cent of the02population aged 16 and older are02fully vaccinated ― the equivalent of 64.2 per cent of the total population.Neither milestone has a02target date.The ACT and02NSW02are leading the way, with more than 80 per cent of residents fully vaccinated.Vaccine coverage is widest in the ACT, at more than 98 per cent of the adult population, closely followed by NSW, where the Delta outbreak has killed hundreds of people and hospitalised thousands.02Between June 26 ―02when the Delta outbreak plunged Greater Sydney and its surrounds into lockdown02―02and the end of August,02state-wide daily doses quadrupled from roughly 31,000 to 120,000, based on the seven-day moving average.The vaccination gap between young and old is narrowing, with 16- to 39-year-olds across Australia eligible for Pfizer vaccinations from August 30, and 12- to 15-year-olds eligible from September 13.The effect was particularly stark in NSW and later, Victoria, where young adults took up the COVID vaccine at nearly twice the pace of the02rest of the nation.However, the strongest vaccine uptake of the rollout has been among 12- to 15-year-olds. Roughly 2 per cent of this age group per day are receiving a first shot, rising to 3 per cent in NSW and 4 per cent in the ACT.02Even older teens and young adults, who have the next strongest rates,02only ever achieved peaks around 1.5-2.5%, depending on the state.With vaccine coverage at more than 90 per cent in the ACT and NSW, SA and WA02have taken the lead for vaccine uptake.Roughly 3.5 per cent of residents in these jurisdictions are receiving02a first shot of vaccine each week, compared to 2.502per cent across Australia.At its peak at the end of02August, more than 7.5 per cent of NSW residents a week were receiving their first shot of a COVID vaccine, compared to about 5 per cent nationwide.However, these figures vary significantly by region. The data, shown02in the map below, is02for Statistical Area 4 (SA4) boundaries, which are based around labour markets and each have at least 100,000 residents.The vaccination divide between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians continues to worsen. Federal government figures show02it has increased every week since the first figures were released in mid-August.This is despite Indigenous Australians being prioritised in the initial phases of the vaccine rollout02and recent efforts to urgently vaccinate Indigenous people in remote communities threatened by the Delta outbreak.Among the states and territories, the first-dose vaccination gap is 2.5 times worse02in WA as in the ACT.Australia-wide, roughly 5502per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders aged 16 and older are at least partially vaccinated. However, the figures vary significantly by region.In parts of WA and Queensland, less than 40 per cent of the Indigenous people have had at least one dose of vaccine, while in parts of metropolitan Sydney the figure reaches past 8502per cent.The chart below shows Indigenous vaccination rates for the population aged 1602and older, plus the gap between Indigenous and all Australians for02Statistical Area 402boundaries. SA4s02are based around labour markets and each have at least 100,000 residents.More than two-thirds of aged care and disability care residents and workers have had one dose of vaccine and half are fully vaccinated.*On September 6 the federal government stopped supplying the figures02needed to calculated the percentages of people at least partially and fully vaccinated in aged and disability care. The ABC's02request for02these figures is being considered.The COVID-19 vaccination rollout is the single biggest and most complex inoculation campaign in the nation's history.It has been plagued by problems, ranging from delays in international supply, local production and delivery of vaccines both to and within Australia.One of the aims of vaccination is to achieve "herd immunity", which is when enough people are immunised to stop or slow the spread of the disease.The threshold for herd immunity varies with each disease. For measles, for example, about 95 per cent of the population needs to be immunised, whereas for polio, the figure is closer to 80 per cent.The threshold for COVID-19 is still unknown but expert estimates range between 60 and 90 per cent.02(Almost all the vaccines currently being used internationally require two doses several weeks apart. People are not fully vaccinated until they receive the second dose.)Massive chasms between rich and poor have erupted in the contest to vaccinate against coronavirus.Wealthy nations have been accused of hoarding vaccines while poor countries scramble to secure enough supplies to vaccinate their critical workers and most vulnerable citizens.Australia has secured enough doses to fully vaccinate the population six times over, although it is possible that not all of these vaccines will be approved to market.Meanwhile, many02low and lower-middle income countries cannot vaccinate even half their populations.Only the Johnson & Johnson vaccine requires a single shot; all others require two doses several weeks or months apart.The Australian government has five separate agreements for the supply of COVID-19 vaccines.As of September 2021, Pfizer-BioNTech,02Oxford-AstraZeneca,02Moderna's Spikevax and Johnson & Johnson have been provisionally approved for use by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. However02Johnson & Johnson02has not yet been purchased for use in02the national rollout.Delivery of the Pfizer vaccine to "priority groups" of quarantine and border workers, frontline health workers and aged care and disability sector staff and residents began in late February.The first doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were delivered in early March. The government has secured 53.8 million doses of this vaccine.Australia has also joined the COVAX Facility, a global collaboration working for equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, with a commitment to purchase 25.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines for the Australian population.CoronaCheck is RMIT ABC Fact Check's weekly email newsletter dedicated to fighting the misinformation infodemic surrounding the coronavirus outbreak.Low case numbers, eased lockdowns and the fast-approaching new year have prompted Australians to turn their attention to the likelihood of a return to some sort of pre-COVID normal and to the vaccines that may help get us there.In this week's newsletter, we debunk suggestions that the quick start on developing a vaccine meant the pandemic must have been "planned", and look at claims around the efficacy rates of the various vaccine contenders.Posts on social media, however, suggested that it was "strange" that an image of a vial containing the vaccine, which accompanied a recent news report, had March 15, 2020, printed on its label."This was always planned," one Twitter user claimed in response to the image. "What amazes me is how many people fell for it and still do."But what does the date really mean?In short, researchers were simply quick off the mark when developing potential vaccines.Fact Check reached out to Damian Purcell, a virologist at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, who said the image likely showed an early experimental batch of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine."This is plausible as one of the first batches of this vaccine that was prepared in the lab," he told Fact Check in an email."They were already working hard to add the spike sequence into their adenoviral vector and they most definitely would have had their vaccine candidate made by that date in March."He added that in Australia, researchers at the University of Queensland selected a vaccine candidate on February 14, after beginning work on January 12.A spokesman for the University of Oxford confirmed to Fact Check in an email that the photo did indeed show the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and that the date was correct."The team began working on developing a vaccine on 11th January 2020, as soon as the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus became available," he said."In order for the clinical trials to begin in April, the vaccine needed to be developed and assessed in the lab, then tested in animals, and produced to clinical grade (at our clinical biomanufacturing facility) for use in human trials."This work, the spokesman said, took place between January and April, with clinical trials beginning on April 23.False and misleading claims about the various coronavirus vaccines that are showing promising signs of high efficacy have swept social media.Take, for example, a claim that COVID-19 has a survival rate of 99.99 per cent, and that a vaccine would kill more people than the virus itself.As to whether a vaccine would kill more people than the virus, the fact checkers said: "There is no evidence that any COVID-19 vaccine currently being trialled has caused a death, let alone that any vaccine has a fatality rate higher than the disease itself."As the fact checkers pointed out, contrasting vaccine effectiveness with survival rates was not a like-for-like comparison."The comparison with the reported effectiveness of the … vaccine is misleading, as that's looking at how many people get infected, not how many die."This argument, the fact checkers said, relied on enough people in the population acquiring and recovering from COVID-19 (which would, in most cases, prevent them from falling ill again) for the country to reach so-called "herd immunity"."Public health experts, however, have said that threshold is still a ways off ― and that allowing the virus to spread uncontrolled would lead to many needless deaths," FactCheck.org found."A better approach, they say, is to stave off the spread of the virus until a vaccine is widely available."The fact checkers also found that Senator Paul's herd immunity efficacy figure wasn't accurate, as it was unclear how many people had been reinfected with COVID-19 after initially recovering.As Germany nears an eye-watering 1 million coronavirus cases, fact checkers have reached a milestone of their own, checking more than 200 claims arising there since the start of the pandemic.The fact checkers found the images were stock photos, and the man was a model.The fact checkers also pointed to a study in the scientific journal Nature which found more than 200,000 people more than normal had died in 21 countries during pandemic. The excess mortality was particularly evident in populations over the age of 60.Also incorrect was a claim made by the same lawyer that people not wearing masks in Australia were being "taken to prison". Newtral found Victoria was the only state to make mask wearing mandatory, with non-compliance resulting in a fine, not jail time.There was also no evidence that the woman had passed out.Earlier this month, One Nation leader Pauline Hanson put forward a motion in the Senate acknowledging that "adopting the policies of the World Economic Forum's proposed 'Great Reset' would have a devastating impact on the economic wellbeing and individual freedoms of Australians".But is the Great Reset really a ploy to "push socialist and neo-Marxist policies onto Australians without the people's consent and pave the way for big controlling government, suppression of free speech, and reduced property rights", as Senator Hanson claims?"The plan explores how countries might recover from the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic," the fact checkers said.Suggestions, however, that the World Economic Forum "has the authority to tell other countries what to do, or that it is coordinating a secret cabal of world leaders" were "wholly without evidence"."A January 2021 WEF summit will have the "Great Reset" as a theme, but as with every WEF meeting none of the discussions will be legally binding."CoronaCheck is RMIT ABC Fact Check's weekly email newsletter dedicated to fighting the misinformation infodemic surrounding the coronavirus outbreak.Shocking footage of a young man being turfed unconscious from a Melbourne pub has spread online, with some sources suggesting the incident came after the man refused to comply with a mandatory mask mandate. In this week's newsletter, we explain that the incident had nothing to do with COVID-19.We've also taken a look at a Danish study supposedly showing masks to be "useless", and check in with Argentina, which has one of the world's highest counts of coronavirus cases."Medical police state HORRORS in Australia: Young man choked out, slammed to the ground, heaved out of a restaurant for not wearing a mask," a headline from the popular conspiracy theory website Natural News declares.According to an accompanying article, the video "shows the shocking brutality of the newly emboldened medical police state enforcers who now believe they have the right to assault, injure, kidnap or even kill people who refuse to comply with senseless mask mandates or dangerous vaccine mandates".But that's not quite right.Rather, the man was reported to have been thrown out of the Croydon pub for "bad behaviour" before he climbed a fence to regain entry and poured himself a beer from behind the bar.So, who is behind the spread of the false claim linking the incident to mask mandates?Natural News is believed to control at least 200 news-sharing websites but has been given a score of just 5 out of 100 for credibility by NewsGuard, a service which tracks fake news websites."The site has repeatedly promoted false and unsubstantiated claims about the COVID-19 pandemic."The site has since bypassed the ban by drawing on its wide network of domains through which it shares its false and misleading content."Many of these sites are not blocked on Facebook, which means that Natural News content can find its way onto the platform by way of these domains," Vox reported.In the case of the Melbourne pub footage, Fact Check found identical news articles posted to six sites, four of which had been shared across Facebook.A Danish study into the effectiveness of masks in stopping the spread of COVID-19 has been shared widely online, with some suggesting the study found the face coverings did not work as intended or were "useless".But what did the study actually find?"However, this is not proof that masks don't have a significant effect, as the study didn't look at whether mask wearing protects others by stopping wearers from exhaling the virus," Full Fact said."The study found that face masks did not have a large protective effect for wearers ― not that masks provide no protection at all or don't offer benefits to others," the fact checkers said.According to the Times, editors of the journal which published the study also said that "masks likely need to be worn by most if not all people to reduce community infection rates" and that the results of the study should provide motivation for widespread mask wearing."It also did not examine whether masks reduced the spread of the coronavirus from infected individuals, which experts say is the primary reason for mask-wearing recommendations."In reality, the footage was of a port in Romania, not Spain, and showed machinery used to dehydrate plants to be fed to livestock."The text does not refer to the mandatory application of a future vaccine; nor does it establish 'legal immunity for laboratories due to side effects'."However, according to the fact checkers, the event took place in October 2019."According to official data, there is no evidence available to establish a correlation between the increase in infections and the concentration of people outdoors."With the east coast sweltering amid record November temperatures and the summer bushfire season fast approaching, Australia's record on climate action is again in the spotlight.During an interview on the ABC's 7.30 program on November 11, 2020, Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese criticised the Federal Government's record on cutting greenhouse gas emissions.Asked about Labor's policies, Mr Albanese said: "[W]e had a 15 per cent reduction when we were in government. Up to … the end of last year, there had only been a 1 per cent reduction under this Government since it came to office in 2013."Annual greenhouse gas emissions fell 14.4 per cent under the last Labor government. By the end of 2019, under the Coalition, they had fallen 1.4 per cent.The quarterly figures reveal a similar picture, with Labor recording a drop in emissions of 13.4 per cent, compared with the Coalition's 2.4 per cent.While those changes reflect the numbers available at the time of the claim, emissions have since fallen further, in part due to the effects of COVID-19 on transport.Edited by Ellen McCutchanCoronaCheck is RMIT ABC Fact Check's weekly email newsletter dedicated to fighting the misinformation infodemic surrounding the coronavirus outbreak.While most of the coronavirus misinformation covered in this newsletter has been shared online, COVID conspiracies can also proliferate offline. This week, we've taken a look at a flyer distributed to letterboxes in federal Labor MP Chris Bowen's community.We've also covered a new report that looks into the most prolific COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, and bring you a dispatch from India.In the latest example of coronavirus misinformation moving offline, a flyer distributed to letterboxes in the electorate of federal Labor MP and opposition spokesman for health Chris Bowen, which contains a slew of false claims about the pandemic, and encourages people to watch a widely discredited documentary."Concerning to see dangerous conspiracy theories and anti-vaccine disinformation being spread through letter boxes in our local community," Mr Bowen posted on Facebook above the image."This sort of propaganda is dangerous. If friends or family raise this with you, please advise them to get their COVID information from official and reliable sources," he wrote.Declaring that "the media is lying to you about COVID-19", the flyer claims that the pandemic is a "front" for the enforcement of mandatory vaccines containing microchips, that doctors and hospitals are "paid thousands of dollars" to record COVID-19 cases and deaths, and that testing kits made in China are "faulty"."COVID-19 is no more harmful or contagious than the common flu," the flyer reads. "It has a 99.98 per cent recovery rate. IT IS NOT A PANDEMIC."Each of these claims is incorrect.There is no evidence to support conspiracy theories suggesting that vaccines would be used to "microchip" the population, but this hasn't stopped such claims from gaining traction throughout the pandemic.Reality Check said that while a study funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation had examined whether it was possible to store a person's vaccine records in special ink applied to a person's skin at the same time as a jab, the technology involved an "invisible tattoo" rather than a microchip."[The technology] has not been rolled out yet, would not allow people to be tracked and personal information would not be entered into a database," Reality Check quoted Ana Jaklenec, a scientist involved in the study, as saying.Also bogus is the flyer's claim that doctors and hospitals are paid to record COVID-19 cases and deaths.A spokeswoman for the Department of Health told Fact Check in an email that all claims contained in the flyer, including those relating to payments, were "false".Both the Victorian and Commonwealth health authorities, as well as the peak body representing aged care homes, denied making any such payments.Similarly, Fact Check could find no evidence that testing kits used in Australia were "faulty".While the Minister for Home Affairs, Peter Dutton, had issued a warning over "faulty" home COVID-19 test kits in April, the alert referred to kits unapproved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration."The TGA has confirmed that the test kits are not registered for use in Australia and the importers did not have approval to import them," Mr Dutton said in a media release."The only approved tests for COVID-19 in Australia currently are laboratory-based tests or tests that can be used by health professionals at the point of care such as in hospitals or clinics."Finally, the flyer's claim that COVID-19 has a "recovery rate" of 99.98 per cent and is no more harmful than the flu also doesn't stack up.However, a former head of Australia's federal quarantine program, Paul Barratt, said that was "simply not true".Sydney University professor Anne Twomey said that, importantly, the constitution does not force the Commonwealth to use its quarantine power."The Commonwealth can leave such matters to be dealt with under state laws if it chooses."Cheryl Saunders, a laureate professor emeritus at Melbourne University, told Fact Check that the Commonwealth had not delegated its quarantining power during the pandemic but simply not exercised it.\"And so it becomes a state responsibility," she said.As the world prepares for the widespread rollout of coronavirus vaccines, misinformation researchers at First Draft have identified the key narratives taking hold within vaccine-related conversations online.Photos and videos accounted for 51 per cent of the content scrutinised, the researchers said, while Facebook and Instagram carried the bulk of the content (71 per cent).The report found COVID-19 and vaccine conspiracies played an "outsized role" on social media, and that content referring to Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates made up 6 per cent of the database."Organisations' links to Gates are used to poison their legitimacy and undermine trust in the vaccines they are working to develop," First Draft noted."The types of claims and narratives within these topics, as well as the complete absence of neutral, fact-based, informative posts, underlined the significance of this data deficit," the report concluded."Certain posts claimed Moderna's new potential COVID-19 vaccine will change people's DNA, and some posts presented the mRNA vaccine as the definitive future COVID-19 vaccine or discredited any future COVID-19 vaccine altogether."Other posts, the researchers said, falsely linked the Moderna vaccine to "targeted depopulation efforts".Meanwhile, a lack of "clear, reliable information detailing the steps involved in the vaccine development process, the scientific norms associated with it and what ultimately constitutes a 'safe' vaccine" had paved the way for the proliferation of unscrutinised vaccine information."For example, numerous unverified accounts presenting themselves as news sources or health specialists reported the unveiling of the Russian vaccine 'Sputnik V' in an uncritically positive and largely decontextualized manner," First Draft found."These reports failed to highlight the fact that the vaccine was approved before it had gone through large-scale Phase 3 trials, which provoked widespread concern and objections from the scientific community."Conversely, in some cases, an oversupply of information was to blame for a lack of clarity among the social media posts examined, such as in the case of the frantic reporting on vaccine trials and the "race" to secure the first effective jab.According to the researchers, much of this reporting did not contextualise the "race" or seek to make sense of it, with much of it based solely on press releases from pharmaceutical companies and thus subject to so-called "pharma-spin"."This deluge of reporting ― much of which may be biased toward the interests of pharmaceutical companies ― leaves many more questions than answers, creating more spaces vulnerable to speculation and misinformation."With coronavirus cases nearing 10 million and deaths topping 139,000, India, like the rest of the world, faces a battle not just with COVID-19, but with the infodemic of misinformation related to the virus."Ashok Gehlot, a prominent figure in India's main opposition Indian National Congress party, announced in early November 2020 that Rajasthan would ban the use of firecrackers in Diwali celebrations in a bid to limit air pollution during the COVID-19 pandemic," the fact checkers said.A widely shared photo of Mr Gehlot burning firecrackers, however, was taken in October 2019, before the pandemic and before the fireworks were banned, AFP said.The Government's resourcing of the ANAO, when adjusted for inflation, was 14.34 per cent lower in 2019-20 than in Labor's final budget.When considered as a share of overall government expenditure, there is an even clearer trend of dwindling resourcing of the ANAO's budget against increased public spending.While in 2001, government resourcing of the ANAO accounted for 0.02761 per cent of overall expenditure, by 2019-20 this figure had fallen to 0.01303 per cent ― a drop of 47.19 per cent.If the ANAO's budget is funded as planned in 2020-21, this figure would decline even further to 0.01108 per cent, representing a drop of 60 per cent since 2000-01.But Fact Check found Labor to not be absolved of all responsibility either, with government resourcing of the ANAO beginning its decline in real terms under a previous Labor government.It began with a trickle that many feared would become a tsunami. Canberra silversmith Marissa Ziesing was so afraid of being part of that wave of infection that she delayed going to hospital even when her fever broke 40 degrees Celsius. The 35-year-old had been sick with a cough and temperature for six days but had already returned a negative test for COVID-19. "I was calling the nurse helpline and they were saying to call an ambulance, but I didn't," she says."It sounds really dramatic but at the time they were saying that Australia was going to be like Italy [where hospitals were overwhelmed] … I was just really worried about wasting tests and wasting resources and putting anyone at risk."So Marissa stayed put for another night in her friend's spare room where she was quarantining after returning to Australia from her adopted home in London.The next day, Marissa was hospitalised with COVID-19. Her earlier test had been a false negative."I wasn't ventilated but I was on oxygen. I had issues with my heart and kidney and liver … I was really scared," she says.It was March 30. The virus had already killed more than 39,600 people worldwide. Ten months later, another 2 million would be dead.One of the most terrifying aspects of contracting COVID-19 so early in the pandemic was how little the world knew about the disease, Marissa says."The doctors were telling me how they were reading about it, saying, 'Well, from what we've read about what you're saying …' because that's all they had to go on."Marissa is among the hundreds who responded to an ABC survey about how the pandemic has affected Australians.Returned travellers like Marissa make up two-thirds of the nearly 6,800 people diagnosed with coronavirus during the first wave of infections in Australia.But these figures should be taken with a grain of salt, says Deakin University chair in epidemiology Catherine Bennett. During the first wave in March and April, Australia's limited testing capacity meant the protocol targeted returned travellers."You're only going to find [positive cases] in the people you're testing … We actively did not measure community transmission, even if you had symptoms," she says.This means Australia's first-wave case numbers underestimate not only the true number of infections but, more specifically, locally spread infections. "The first wave was bigger than we will ever know," Professor Bennett says."But lockdown did its job and ultimately stopped that [variant] completely."The second wave, however, would prove a far tougher beast.The strain of the virus circulating in Australia during the first wave had all but petered out by the time a family of four returned travellers was transferred to Melbourne's Rydges on Swanston hotel.It was May 15 and two members had been diagnosed with COVID-19. The remaining two would test positive a few days later. Even though they were in quarantine, security guards allowed the family out of their room for walks through common areas of the hotel, which may have been how the virus was transmitted.Within a week, the family had infected two security guards and a hotel worker. By June 18, the cluster had swelled to 17.Meanwhile, across town at the Stamford Plaza, a single man diagnosed with COVID-19 on June 4 and a couple diagnosed on June 15 and 16 became the origin of a second quarantine hotel cluster, this one numbering 46 cases.Genomic testing would later trace 99 per cent of second-wave cases to these two quarantine hotel breaches. Roughly 90 per cent were linked to the Rydges hotel, with the remainder linked to the Stamford."The Stamford variant was a precursor to the current [more infectious] UK strain … so the one that should have been, if anything, more infectious, actually got shut down quite quickly," Professor Bennett says. The Rydges variant took a wildly different turn. It seeded thousands of infections, killed hundreds and triggered one of the longest and toughest lockdowns in the world."We did get to zero [cases] but … no-one would say 111 days of lockdown is a success story," Professor Bennett says."The question has to be asked: Did we work as well as we could have, as quickly as we could have … given the high cost to life and health?" The catastrophic second wave erupted from the convergence of two fault lines: one from nature, the other man-made."[Melbourne] had to have an incredibly long lockdown … because the virus was just constantly being re-seeded back into the community," Professor Bennett says."But in parallel, we also discovered the cracks in our contact tracing system."Contact tracing is one of the most critical elements of infection control, according to epidemiologist and UNSW professor of global biosecurity Raina MacIntyre. A single positive case may have 10 to 20 contacts, she says. If there are 100 new cases a day, contact tracers must track down 1,000 to 2,000 contacts within 24 hours."That means that during the Victorian second wave, at any one time they might have had 200,000 to 500,000 people in quarantine who needed to be monitored daily," Professor MacIntyre says."And on top of that, they had to identify all the new contacts that occurred each day."It is a mammoth task. The system was simply overwhelmed."Early on in the pandemic … there was a good recognition that we needed more hospital beds, more ventilators, more ICU beds ― and bang, it was all done. By March, we'd expanded ICU capacity more than 100 per cent," Professor MacIntyre says."But nobody recognised the need for surge capacity in the public health system, which is responsible for contact tracing and outbreak investigation."The consequences would be dire.The dynamic of Victoria's second wave was completely different to the first wave, according to experts.During the first wave, the biggest outbreaks were linked to returned travellers, particularly those who had been on cruise ships such as the Ruby Princess, which engendered a cluster of more than 850 crew and passengers.Victoria's second wave, however, "was all community transmission", Professor MacIntyre says. "That's much, much harder to control … Shutting down a border is not going to fix that."In the second wave, the virus spread from hotel quarantine to homes, between neighbours and across work sites.Essential workers, many of whom were casually employed at multiple workplaces, bore the brunt of its fury as nursing homes, schools, hospitals, meatworks and supply distribution centres became the centre of the second wave. "[They were] the very places that you can't shut down, even in the strictest of lockdowns," Professor Bennett says."It led to a really rapid escalation in case numbers … [and] multiple spreader events, particularly in that north-west corridor in Melbourne."It was these people's families, their workplaces, their schools, their nursing homes, primarily … They were the hardest hit."As the virus cut a swathe through the city, young workers were also swept up, with people in their 20s recording the highest number of diagnoses of any age group. "There was a lot of, 'Oh, look, all these young adults are still spreading the virus' and somehow it was all about partying," Doherty Institute professor Jodie McVernon says."But who was working in the supermarkets and the hospitals? Who was delivering your groceries and takeaway meals? They were the people actually out there, even in lockdown, working at the front line."From workplaces, it seeped into homes. At the public housing towers in North Melbourne and Flemington, the number of infections soared more than 10-fold in a month, from 28 to 310.High-rise buildings with shared amenities, crowded units and a vulnerable population, the towers were a tinderbox for the disease."If you are four people living in a four-bedroom, two-bathroom house, it's going to be much easier to isolate yourselves from each other than if you are 10 people living in a two-bedroom, one-bathroom unit," Professor McVernon says."There were a lot of shared facilities and common spaces like laundries and stairwells where people from many, many households would congregate very close together."And there were also quite a lot of elderly people living alone in those towers who were more vulnerable to severe outcomes."Data showing the percentage of local- versus overseas-spread infections tells the story.In Victoria, overseas cases plummeted from 63 per cent of confirmed cases at the peak of the first wave to just 5 per cent.This compares with 89 per cent in WA, 76 per cent in Queensland and 57 per cent in NSW.Even starker are the figures at local council level. Among Victorian councils with more than 500 confirmed cases, the share of local infections climbs as high as 99 per cent in the blue-collar areas of Brimbank and Wyndham. Brimbank battled three major meatworks outbreaks ― Cedar Meats, JBS Abattoir and Somerville Retail Services. Wyndham is home to Al-Taqwa College, where infections climbed past 200, and some of the deadliest nursing home clusters, including Baptcare Wyndham Lodge and Glendale.In NSW, the rate of local transmission has been lower across the board. Among councils with more than 50 confirmed cases, the western Sydney suburb of Fairfield, home to the Thai Rock restaurant cluster, has the highest share of locally spread transmissions, at 84 per cent.It is followed by Liverpool, location of the Crossroads Hotel, at 73 per cent.According to Professor Bennett, "the whole thing could have ended six weeks earlier" had we understood that the second wave was driven by transmission across essential industries and had Victoria's contact tracing been up to the task.But even under stage four restrictions, Melburnians were allowed to leave the house for work."We kept tightening up the community lockdown ... and that's the part I still think wasn't the answer," she says."Clearly, as we learned in the second wave, lockdown doesn't work against workplace outbreaks among essential workers."When Susie's mother became the first aged care resident to die with coronavirus, no-one ― not even the doctors ― knew her mother had the disease.Judy, as she was fondly known to her family, was a resident at BaptistCare's Dorothy Henderson Lodge, in Sydney's north-west. The nursing home became the centre of Australia's first locally spread cluster in March.A former pianist and piano teacher, Judy loved to read the newspaper and tried to instil in her children the value of behaving "properly" and having good table manners, Susie says."Mum always used to say that when she was a bit upset or angry, she'd go and sit at the piano and after an hour everything would be fine."Judy, 94, was taken to hospital with a cough and suspected pneumonia but wasn't tested for COVID-19 until after she had passed away on March 3."There was no mention of COVID, no safety precautions, nothing … The hospital advised us to gather the close family for final goodbyes. The nursing home had asked us to give her a big kiss from them," Susie says."I was holding her hand when she died … You just think, well, that wouldn't happen now, not with everything we know [about the disease]."Three of the six family members who were with Judy when she died also contracted the virus.It was later revealed that a carer at the home was diagnosed with COVID-19 on the day Judy died. Within five weeks, the cluster had expanded to five staff and 17 residents, six of whom died."We still don't really know what happened," Susie says."We were never told whether that carer had attended to Mum or not. They [Dorothy Henderson] didn't talk to us again for a very long time … We were just sort of left out in the cold."A BaptistCare spokesperson told the ABC their staff "worked very hard in cooperation with health authorities to contain the outbreak, which was certainly challenging in those early days of the pandemic"."Even now, we are seeing health authorities globally continuing to learn and adapt their responses to the challenges presented by the virus."-Judy's family was the first of hundreds whose loved ones in aged care would die with coronavirus.Throughout March, Australia's cumulative case count doubled every three to four days, surging from less than 30 diagnosed cases on March 1 to 4,500 within a month.By the peak of the first wave, active cases outnumbered recoveries by more than 15:1.By the end of the first wave, 103 people had died, including 30 in aged care.By mid-June, daily new cases had fallen to single digits and recoveries outnumbered active cases by 16:1.There were no active cases in aged care.It was the calm before the storm.On July 30, as the second wave began to crest, new cases hit a record high of 746 in a single day.By the end of August, aged care residents and staff made up two-thirds of the nation's active cases. At some facilities, outbreaks simmered for more than three months.By December, one-third of infected aged care residents had died.Aged care residents, including those receiving in-home care, make up 15 per cent of Australia's confirmed cases but 75 per cent of deaths.At least 5,078 of some 18,700 second-wave infections in Victoria ― more than one in four ― are linked to aged care, according to the data published by Victoria's Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) on January 22. Among the aged care cases, just under 40 per cent are residents, 38 per cent are staff and about 23 per cent are other linked cases such as household contacts, spanning some 70 facilities. The data only includes aged care homes with five or more confirmed cases. The tragedy was not unforeseeable. Nursing homes are "an incubator for outbreaks", Professor MacIntyre says."We've had experience with aged care outbreaks for decades and decades. We know that aged care is at high risk for big outbreaks of things like flu and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) and gastroenteritis."There's a lot of vulnerable people living in close proximity, staff coming and going, and moving between residents."Doherty Institute's Professor McVernon said the tragedy that had played out in nursing homes reflected "something about our society … and what we invest in aged care"."In Switzerland, where they've had very, very high rates of infection, they've had very low rates of outbreaks in aged care," she said."And in Switzerland, once you put your loved ones in aged care, you will not have an inheritance but they will have a very comfortable life. So I think you get what you pay for."More than 28,500 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in Australia since the first cases were confirmed a year ago.No doubt the tally will continue to rise. The question is: how quickly?Professor MacIntyre warns that Australia's "stubborn refusal" to recognise the role of airborne transmission in the spread of coronavirus is "absolutely a flashpoint"."Australia has been one of the last countries to acknowledge airborne transmission as a major way that the virus spreads," she says."Even the WHO and the US, which were denying it at the beginning, are now acknowledging that it's important ― particularly indoors."Recognising the role of airborne transmission would allow Australia to address two critical weaknesses that continue to threaten health and safety, she says. The first is respiratory protection, particularly for workers in quarantine settings, and the second is ventilation, which is especially problematic in high-rise buildings.But Australia has the advantage of two vital weapons in our fight against the disease, Professor Vernon says."Political will and the public. Without those things, it doesn't matter what the expert advice is. It doesn't matter what the armoury of vaccines or medicines or anything else is," she says."If the public doesn't go along with the advice, if they don't present for testing, if they don't change their behaviours, if they don't participate ... you can't go anywhere."Canberra silversmith Marissa Ziesing ended up being hospitalised for seven days. She is still recovering, physically and mentally."The only thing I'd had before [COVID-19] was low blood pressure … Even now my chest is not the same," she says."I have lung issues and I get these sort of heart flutters. I lost hair as well. Like, two months afterwards, my hair all started falling out … I think from the shock to the body. And I still have days where I just hit the couch."But between the tears, the heartache and the sheer exhaustion, Marissa has found joy in reconnecting with family and friends from her childhood city. She says she doesn't regret being back.It's a sentiment everyone in Australia should share, Professor MacIntyre says. "We are all very fortunate to have had the random chance of being born here or migrating here or just being here [during the pandemic]," she says."I think we need to think about that ― about what kind of suffering and catastrophes are going on outside of our borders ― and be grateful."Queensland's top human rights body is taking more than six months to respond to complaints02as it is inundated with questions about the state's COVID-19 public health orders, vaccine02mandates, and quarantine policy.The Queensland Human Rights Commission (QHRC) handles complaints and provides guidance around discrimination, vilification, sexual harassment, and other matters under the state's Anti-Discrimination Act.But since the pandemic, the commission has been fielding constant calls relating to that, and has begun releasing fact sheets for frequently asked questions.It has offices in Brisbane, Rockhampton, Townsville, and Cairns.A spokeswoman said the commission received more than 1,100 COVID-related enquiries since January 1 this year."There have been periods this year,02usually as a result of changes02in public health directions,02when COVID-related enquiries made up over 35 per cent of all enquiries to the commission," the spokeswoman said.In the past 18 months, the commission has received 300 enquiries relating to vaccinations, and 50 formal complaints."They may relate to a variety of vaccine issues02including complaints from returning travellers who are fully vaccinated but still required to quarantine, or government-mandated vaccination," the spokeswoman said.Queensland has mandated vaccines for some select groups such as Queensland health workers, police officers, and truck drivers who cross the state border.Only 55 per cent of the region is fully vaccinated."I don't think the problem here is insufficient resources. We have clinics all over and our problem now is people," he said."People need to go and get vaccinated."The QHRC does not make rulings in relation to complaints, but instead works to try to resolve complaints as a neutral third party through conciliation, change of policy, compensation, or an apology.The QHRC says that if you are subject to a mandatory vaccination policy, that is a "lawful public health direction" and not a breach of human rights."This is because it is accepted that vaccination is required to protect the community."Merely being opposed to vaccination is unlikely to be sufficient to demonstrate an unreasonable limitation on your rights."The ACT has recorded 15 new locally acquired COVID-19 cases.There are five people in hospital with the virus, including two people02in intensive care C one person02requires02ventilation.93.6 per cent of Canberrans aged 12 and over have now received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.There are currently 141 active cases of COVID-19 in the territory.The junior campus of Wanniassa School in Canberra's south has been closed due to a growing COVID-19 cluster.An individual was unknowingly infectious with COVID-19 while at the school on October 27, 28 and 29.02ACT Health said there have been a number of further cases identified and advised anyone who has been on the school's junior campus since02Monday, October 2502to get tested and quarantine until they received a negative result.ACT Health said it was also working02closely with the Education Directorate to provide support to staff and students.Over the border in NSW, Queanbeyan Public School has also been closed after a member of the school community tested positive for COVID-19.All staff and students have been asked to self-isolate until they receive further advice.The school will remain closed while contract tracing and cleaning is02carried out.It was the first country to vaccinate, the first to reopen, then the first to widely implement a booster shot.02Now Israel is returning to life close to normal only six weeks after the peak of its worst COVID-19 wave yet.But today, its restaurants are bustling, cinemas and theatres are packed, university lecture halls are full02and the major airport is heaving.Deaths and new infections have plummeted to the single and triple digits, and the country will be welcoming overseas tourists from November 1.So how did the country go from a cautionary tale to a success story in less than two months? The answer lies only partially in vaccines.Eschewing harsh lockdowns, it instead rolled out a mandatory booster shot to everyone over the age of 12. While masks were compulsory in certain settings, its economy remained defiantly open."We were faced with a crucial decision," said Professor Cyrille Cohen of Bar Ilan University, who is also a member of the Israeli government advisory panel on COVID-19 vaccines."Should we go back into lockdown? Should we start to think about again closing our businesses and schools? Or should we abide by another solution?"The shot was still found to be more than 90 per cent effective in preventing disease.But for the many Israelis who had been double-vaccinated in January, immunity had in some cases waned to just one-fifth of what it was when they were first jabbed.Without any real-world data on the efficacy of booster shots in the wider community, the Israeli government took a fateful gamble.In late August, the government approved a third shot as a booster for young adults and teens, and then progressively to categories of adults.At the time, some scientists spoke against the decision, arguing it lacked clear evidence of any benefit and that the focus should instead be directed towards convincing the unvaccinated to accept their first shots.But the gamble soon appeared to pay off.02As the booster campaign ramped up, new Delta infections, hospitalisations and deaths began to dramatically tumble. More than a third of the Israeli population has now been triple-vaccinated.Soon, a clear pattern began to emerge among severe cases of the disease and those dying as a result of it ― they largely did not include people who had received three shots of the vaccine."Almost 95 to 99 per cent of the cases that we saw in the hospital here were those patients who were unvaccinated, or those patients who had not received the booster shot," said Dr David Katz, the director of the COVID-19 unit at Shaare Zedek Medical Centre, a major private hospital in Jerusalem.When the green pass program was first introduced in March, Israelis had to use the app to show proof of double vaccination in order to enter public venues like restaurants and bars or attend large gatherings.But the definition of "fully vaccinated" has changed, so Israelis will now have to show three doses on their green passes02― their original two plus a booster ― in order to access the same places they did only a few months ago.The system isn't perfect. Compliance can at times be patchy ― not all businesses check for vaccination status, for example.But Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has made it clear the system will remain for some time, telling local media, "it keeps us safe and [allows us] to keep Israel open".Either way, the streets of Israel's cities are alive.Ultra-orthodox Jewish couples ride packed buses, friends laze under trees in the trendy Dizengoff neighbourhood of Tel Aviv, and Palestinian children chase each other across the cobblestones of Jerusalem's ancient Old City.As the fourth wave tapers off in Israel, questions are now turning to the role of booster shots in the long-term life of the pandemic.As new variants emerge and spread, will reliance on updated booster shots become the way wealthy countries manage the pandemic for many years to come?There isn't enough data yet to decide that for sure, or even to determine if there will be a need for another dose at all, according to Professor Cohen."We know that scenario from other viruses, like flu ―02we get vaccinated every year so that you adapt the vaccine to the strain or the possible variants," he said.02Even if Israel's booster campaign was the most important factor in so quickly overcoming the country's summer Delta surge, it's unlikely any type of booster vaccine will be able to sustain that alone, said Ron Balicer, chief innovation officer of major Israeli health fund Clalit Health Services.A balance of mask mandates, enforcement of the green pass system02and widespread testing with a combination of PCR and rapid antigen tests have also played a part.For Australians, who have begun to emerge from some of the world's longest and harshest lockdowns as Delta swept the eastern states over winter, the Israeli experience offers some hope that lockdowns may not always be the first option governments reach for.But one thing seems incontrovertible: while there is no silver bullet to managing COVID, vaccines remain the most important tool to doing so.Australia has reached a key COVID vaccination milestone with more than 80 per cent of the population aged 16 and older now double-dosed.
The news comes as NSW joins02the ACT among the jurisdictions with at least0290 per cent of adult residents fully vaccinated.
Victoria, with more than 85 per cent of its residents aged over 16 now fully vaccinated, is expected to reach the 90 per cent mark before the end of02November.
However, Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory are still playing catch-up and are not projected to reach the 90 per cent milestone until the new year.
The data is in the02charts below, which track how the states and territories are progressing in the coronavirus vaccination rollout, as well as how Australia compares to the rest of the world.
Both sets of numbers are updated daily, so bookmark this page to stay up-to-date.
Skip to a section:
Australia is now delivering one million doses every 3-4 days, compared with 45 days for the first one million doses, 20 days for the next million doses and 17 days for the third million total doses.
Australia's vaccination program has picked up pace since local outbreaks in multiple states plunged millions into lockdown.
The calculations assume a constant pace based on the02seven-day moving average for 1st doses plus the interval between doses in each jurisdiction until a week before the estimated date. Within a week of the date, the calculation uses the seven-day moving average for 2nd doses.
According to the national roadmap, Australia will move to the next phase of opening up when 70 per cent of the02population aged 16 and older have had two doses of vaccine. This is the equivalent of 56.2 per cent of the total population.
The third phase will come into force when 80 per cent of the02population aged 16 and older are02fully vaccinated ― the equivalent of 64.2 per cent of the total population.
Neither milestone has a02target date.
The ACT and02NSW02are leading the way, with at least0290 per cent of adult residents fully vaccinated.
Vaccine coverage is widest in the ACT, at more than 9902per cent of the adult population, closely followed by NSW, where the Delta outbreak has killed hundreds of people and hospitalised thousands.02
Between June 26 ―02when the Delta outbreak plunged Greater Sydney and its surrounds into lockdown02―02and the end of August,02state-wide daily doses quadrupled from roughly 31,000 to 120,000, based on the seven-day moving average.
The vaccination gap between young and old is narrowing, with 16- to 39-year-olds across Australia eligible for Pfizer vaccinations from August 30, and 12- to 15-year-olds eligible from September 13.
The effect was particularly stark in NSW and later, Victoria, where young adults took up the COVID vaccine at nearly twice the pace of the02rest of the nation.
However, the strongest vaccine uptake of the rollout has been among 12- to 15-year-olds. In the first month of being eligible, roughly 2 per cent of this age group per day were receiving a first shot, rising to 3 per cent in NSW and 4 per cent in the ACT.02Even older teens and young adults, who have the next strongest rates,02only ever achieved peaks around 2 per cent a day, depending on the state.
With vaccine coverage at more than 90 per cent in the ACT and NSW, SA and WA02have taken the lead for vaccine uptake.
Roughly 3.5 per cent of residents in these jurisdictions are receiving02a first shot of vaccine each week, compared to 2.502per cent across Australia.
At its peak at the end of02August, more than 7.5 per cent of NSW residents a week were receiving their first shot of a COVID vaccine, compared to about 5 per cent nationwide.
However, these figures vary significantly by region. The data, shown02in the map below, is02for Statistical Area 4 (SA4) boundaries, which are based around labour markets and each have at least 100,000 residents.
The vaccination divide between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians continues to worsen. Federal government figures show02it has increased every week since the first figures were released in mid-August.
This is despite Indigenous Australians being prioritised in the initial phases of the vaccine rollout02and recent efforts to urgently vaccinate Indigenous people in remote communities threatened by the Delta outbreak.
Among the states and territories, the first-dose vaccination gap is 2.5 times worse02in WA as in the ACT or Victoria.
Australia-wide, roughly two-thirds of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders aged 16 and older are at least partially vaccinated. However, the figures vary significantly by region.
In parts of WA and Queensland, less than half of Indigenous adults have had at least one dose of vaccine, while in parts of metropolitan Sydney the figure reaches past 8502per cent.
The chart below shows Indigenous vaccination rates for the population aged 1602and older, plus the gap between Indigenous and all Australians for02Statistical Area 402boundaries. SA4s02are based around labour markets and each have at least 100,000 residents.
As of November 7, more than 85 per cent of aged care residents and more than 95 per cent of aged care workers in Australia are fully vaccinated.
Roughly 80 per cent of disability care residents and 77 per cent of02NDIS-screened workers02are fully vaccinated.
*On September 6 the federal government stopped supplying the figures02needed to update the chart below. It has not responded to requests for this data.
The COVID-19 vaccination rollout is the single biggest and most complex inoculation campaign in the nation's history.
It has been plagued by problems, ranging from delays in international supply, local production and delivery of vaccines both to and within Australia.
One of the aims of vaccination is to achieve "herd immunity", which is when enough people are immunised to stop or slow the spread of the disease.
The threshold for herd immunity varies with each disease. For measles, for example, about 95 per cent of the population needs to be immunised, whereas for polio, the figure is closer to 80 per cent.
Massive chasms between rich and poor have erupted in the contest to vaccinate against coronavirus.
Wealthy nations have been accused of hoarding vaccines while poor countries scramble to secure enough supplies to vaccinate their critical workers and most vulnerable citizens.
Australia has secured enough doses to fully vaccinate the population six times over, although it is possible that not all of these vaccines will be approved to market.
Meanwhile, many02low and lower-middle income countries cannot vaccinate even half their populations.
Only the Johnson & Johnson vaccine requires a single shot; all others require two doses several weeks or months apart.
The Australian government has five separate agreements for the supply of COVID-19 vaccines.
As of September 2021, Pfizer-BioNTech,02Oxford-AstraZeneca,02Moderna's Spikevax and Johnson & Johnson have been provisionally approved for use by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. However02Johnson & Johnson02has not yet been purchased for use in02the national rollout.
Delivery of the Pfizer vaccine to "priority groups" of quarantine and border workers, frontline health workers and aged care and disability sector staff and residents began in late February.
The first doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were delivered in early March. The government has secured 53.8 million doses of this vaccine.
Australia has also joined the COVAX Facility, a global collaboration working for equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, with a commitment to purchase 25.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines for the Australian population.

Low case numbers, eased lockdowns and the fast-approaching new year have prompted Australians to turn their attention to the likelihood of a return to some sort of pre-COVID normal and to the vaccines that may help get us there.
In this week's newsletter, we debunk suggestions that the quick start on developing a vaccine meant the pandemic must have been "planned", and look at claims around the efficacy rates of the various vaccine contenders.
Posts on social media, however, suggested that it was "strange" that an image of a vial containing the vaccine, which accompanied a recent news report, had March 15, 2020, printed on its label.
"This was always planned," one Twitter user claimed in response to the image. "What amazes me is how many people fell for it and still do."
But what does the date really mean?
In short, researchers were simply quick off the mark when developing potential vaccines.
Fact Check reached out to Damian Purcell, a virologist at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, who said the image likely showed an early experimental batch of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.
"This is plausible as one of the first batches of this vaccine that was prepared in the lab," he told Fact Check in an email.
"They were already working hard to add the spike sequence into their adenoviral vector and they most definitely would have had their vaccine candidate made by that date in March."
He added that in Australia, researchers at the University of Queensland selected a vaccine candidate on February 14, after beginning work on January 12.
A spokesman for the University of Oxford confirmed to Fact Check in an email that the photo did indeed show the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and that the date was correct.
"The team began working on developing a vaccine on 11th January 2020, as soon as the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus became available," he said.
"In order for the clinical trials to begin in April, the vaccine needed to be developed and assessed in the lab, then tested in animals, and produced to clinical grade (at our clinical biomanufacturing facility) for use in human trials."
This work, the spokesman said, took place between January and April, with clinical trials beginning on April 23.
False and misleading claims about the various coronavirus vaccines that are showing promising signs of high efficacy have swept social media.
Take, for example, a claim that COVID-19 has a survival rate of 99.99 per cent, and that a vaccine would kill more people than the virus itself.
As to whether a vaccine would kill more people than the virus, the fact checkers said: "There is no evidence that any COVID-19 vaccine currently being trialled has caused a death, let alone that any vaccine has a fatality rate higher than the disease itself."
As the fact checkers pointed out, contrasting vaccine effectiveness with survival rates was not a like-for-like comparison.
"The comparison with the reported effectiveness of the … vaccine is misleading, as that's looking at how many people get infected, not how many die."
This argument, the fact checkers said, relied on enough people in the population acquiring and recovering from COVID-19 (which would, in most cases, prevent them from falling ill again) for the country to reach so-called "herd immunity".
"Public health experts, however, have said that threshold is still a ways off ― and that allowing the virus to spread uncontrolled would lead to many needless deaths," FactCheck.org found.
"A better approach, they say, is to stave off the spread of the virus until a vaccine is widely available."
The fact checkers also found that Senator Paul's herd immunity efficacy figure wasn't accurate, as it was unclear how many people had been reinfected with COVID-19 after initially recovering.
As Germany nears an eye-watering 1 million coronavirus cases, fact checkers have reached a milestone of their own, checking more than 200 claims arising there since the start of the pandemic.
The fact checkers found the images were stock photos, and the man was a model.
The fact checkers also pointed to a study in the scientific journal Nature which found more than 200,000 people more than normal had died in 21 countries during pandemic. The excess mortality was particularly evident in populations over the age of 60.
Also incorrect was a claim made by the same lawyer that people not wearing masks in Australia were being "taken to prison". Newtral found Victoria was the only state to make mask wearing mandatory, with non-compliance resulting in a fine, not jail time.
There was also no evidence that the woman had passed out.
Earlier this month, One Nation leader Pauline Hanson put forward a motion in the Senate acknowledging that "adopting the policies of the World Economic Forum's proposed 'Great Reset' would have a devastating impact on the economic wellbeing and individual freedoms of Australians".
But is the Great Reset really a ploy to "push socialist and neo-Marxist policies onto Australians without the people's consent and pave the way for big controlling government, suppression of free speech, and reduced property rights", as Senator Hanson claims?
"The plan explores how countries might recover from the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic," the fact checkers said.
Suggestions, however, that the World Economic Forum "has the authority to tell other countries what to do, or that it is coordinating a secret cabal of world leaders" were "wholly without evidence".
"A January 2021 WEF summit will have the "Great Reset" as a theme, but as with every WEF meeting none of the discussions will be legally binding."
CoronaCheck is RMIT ABC Fact Check's weekly email newsletter dedicated to fighting the misinformation infodemic surrounding the coronavirus outbreak.
Shocking footage of a young man being turfed unconscious from a Melbourne pub has spread online, with some sources suggesting the incident came after the man refused to comply with a mandatory mask mandate. In this week's newsletter, we explain that the incident had nothing to do with COVID-19.
We've also taken a look at a Danish study supposedly showing masks to be "useless", and check in with Argentina, which has one of the world's highest counts of coronavirus cases.
"Medical police state HORRORS in Australia: Young man choked out, slammed to the ground, heaved out of a restaurant for not wearing a mask," a headline from the popular conspiracy theory website Natural News declares.
According to an accompanying article, the video "shows the shocking brutality of the newly emboldened medical police state enforcers who now believe they have the right to assault, injure, kidnap or even kill people who refuse to comply with senseless mask mandates or dangerous vaccine mandates".
But that's not quite right.
Rather, the man was reported to have been thrown out of the Croydon pub for "bad behaviour" before he climbed a fence to regain entry and poured himself a beer from behind the bar.
So, who is behind the spread of the false claim linking the incident to mask mandates?
Natural News is believed to control at least 200 news-sharing websites but has been given a score of just 5 out of 100 for credibility by NewsGuard, a service which tracks fake news websites.
"The site has repeatedly promoted false and unsubstantiated claims about the COVID-19 pandemic."
The site has since bypassed the ban by drawing on its wide network of domains through which it shares its false and misleading content.
"Many of these sites are not blocked on Facebook, which means that Natural News content can find its way onto the platform by way of these domains," Vox reported.
In the case of the Melbourne pub footage, Fact Check found identical news articles posted to six sites, four of which had been shared across Facebook.
A Danish study into the effectiveness of masks in stopping the spread of COVID-19 has been shared widely online, with some suggesting the study found the face coverings did not work as intended or were "useless".
But what did the study actually find?
"However, this is not proof that masks don't have a significant effect, as the study didn't look at whether mask wearing protects others by stopping wearers from exhaling the virus," Full Fact said.
"The study found that face masks did not have a large protective effect for wearers ― not that masks provide no protection at all or don't offer benefits to others," the fact checkers said.
According to the Times, editors of the journal which published the study also said that "masks likely need to be worn by most if not all people to reduce community infection rates" and that the results of the study should provide motivation for widespread mask wearing.
"It also did not examine whether masks reduced the spread of the coronavirus from infected individuals, which experts say is the primary reason for mask-wearing recommendations."
In reality, the footage was of a port in Romania, not Spain, and showed machinery used to dehydrate plants to be fed to livestock.
"The text does not refer to the mandatory application of a future vaccine; nor does it establish 'legal immunity for laboratories due to side effects'."
However, according to the fact checkers, the event took place in October 2019.
"According to official data, there is no evidence available to establish a correlation between the increase in infections and the concentration of people outdoors."
With the east coast sweltering amid record November temperatures and the summer bushfire season fast approaching, Australia's record on climate action is again in the spotlight.
During an interview on the ABC's 7.30 program on November 11, 2020, Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese criticised the Federal Government's record on cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
Asked about Labor's policies, Mr Albanese said: "[W]e had a 15 per cent reduction when we were in government. Up to … the end of last year, there had only been a 1 per cent reduction under this Government since it came to office in 2013."
Annual greenhouse gas emissions fell 14.4 per cent under the last Labor government. By the end of 2019, under the Coalition, they had fallen 1.4 per cent.
The quarterly figures reveal a similar picture, with Labor recording a drop in emissions of 13.4 per cent, compared with the Coalition's 2.4 per cent.
While those changes reflect the numbers available at the time of the claim, emissions have since fallen further, in part due to the effects of COVID-19 on transport.

CoronaCheck is RMIT ABC Fact Check's weekly email newsletter dedicated to fighting the misinformation infodemic surrounding the coronavirus outbreak.
While most of the coronavirus misinformation covered in this newsletter has been shared online, COVID conspiracies can also proliferate offline. This week, we've taken a look at a flyer distributed to letterboxes in federal Labor MP Chris Bowen's community.
We've also covered a new report that looks into the most prolific COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, and bring you a dispatch from India.
In the latest example of coronavirus misinformation moving offline, a flyer distributed to letterboxes in the electorate of federal Labor MP and opposition spokesman for health Chris Bowen, which contains a slew of false claims about the pandemic, and encourages people to watch a widely discredited documentary.
"Concerning to see dangerous conspiracy theories and anti-vaccine disinformation being spread through letter boxes in our local community," Mr Bowen posted on Facebook above the image.
"This sort of propaganda is dangerous. If friends or family raise this with you, please advise them to get their COVID information from official and reliable sources," he wrote.
Declaring that "the media is lying to you about COVID-19", the flyer claims that the pandemic is a "front" for the enforcement of mandatory vaccines containing microchips, that doctors and hospitals are "paid thousands of dollars" to record COVID-19 cases and deaths, and that testing kits made in China are "faulty".
"COVID-19 is no more harmful or contagious than the common flu," the flyer reads. "It has a 99.98 per cent recovery rate. IT IS NOT A PANDEMIC."
Each of these claims is incorrect.
There is no evidence to support conspiracy theories suggesting that vaccines would be used to "microchip" the population, but this hasn't stopped such claims from gaining traction throughout the pandemic.
Reality Check said that while a study funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation had examined whether it was possible to store a person's vaccine records in special ink applied to a person's skin at the same time as a jab, the technology involved an "invisible tattoo" rather than a microchip.
"[The technology] has not been rolled out yet, would not allow people to be tracked and personal information would not be entered into a database," Reality Check quoted Ana Jaklenec, a scientist involved in the study, as saying.
Also bogus is the flyer's claim that doctors and hospitals are paid to record COVID-19 cases and deaths.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Health told Fact Check in an email that all claims contained in the flyer, including those relating to payments, were "false".
Both the Victorian and Commonwealth health authorities, as well as the peak body representing aged care homes, denied making any such payments.
Similarly, Fact Check could find no evidence that testing kits used in Australia were "faulty".
While the Minister for Home Affairs, Peter Dutton, had issued a warning over "faulty" home COVID-19 test kits in April, the alert referred to kits unapproved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration.
"The TGA has confirmed that the test kits are not registered for use in Australia and the importers did not have approval to import them," Mr Dutton said in a media release.
"The only approved tests for COVID-19 in Australia currently are laboratory-based tests or tests that can be used by health professionals at the point of care such as in hospitals or clinics."
Finally, the flyer's claim that COVID-19 has a "recovery rate" of 99.98 per cent and is no more harmful than the flu also doesn't stack up.
However, a former head of Australia's federal quarantine program, Paul Barratt, said that was "simply not true".
Sydney University professor Anne Twomey said that, importantly, the constitution does not force the Commonwealth to use its quarantine power.
"The Commonwealth can leave such matters to be dealt with under state laws if it chooses."
Cheryl Saunders, a laureate professor emeritus at Melbourne University, told Fact Check that the Commonwealth had not delegated its quarantining power during the pandemic but simply not exercised it.\
"And so it becomes a state responsibility," she said.
As the world prepares for the widespread rollout of coronavirus vaccines, misinformation researchers at First Draft have identified the key narratives taking hold within vaccine-related conversations online.
Photos and videos accounted for 51 per cent of the content scrutinised, the researchers said, while Facebook and Instagram carried the bulk of the content (71 per cent).
The report found COVID-19 and vaccine conspiracies played an "outsized role" on social media, and that content referring to Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates made up 6 per cent of the database.
"Organisations' links to Gates are used to poison their legitimacy and undermine trust in the vaccines they are working to develop," First Draft noted.
"The types of claims and narratives within these topics, as well as the complete absence of neutral, fact-based, informative posts, underlined the significance of this data deficit," the report concluded.
"Certain posts claimed Moderna's new potential COVID-19 vaccine will change people's DNA, and some posts presented the mRNA vaccine as the definitive future COVID-19 vaccine or discredited any future COVID-19 vaccine altogether."
Other posts, the researchers said, falsely linked the Moderna vaccine to "targeted depopulation efforts".
Meanwhile, a lack of "clear, reliable information detailing the steps involved in the vaccine development process, the scientific norms associated with it and what ultimately constitutes a 'safe' vaccine" had paved the way for the proliferation of unscrutinised vaccine information.
"For example, numerous unverified accounts presenting themselves as news sources or health specialists reported the unveiling of the Russian vaccine 'Sputnik V' in an uncritically positive and largely decontextualized manner," First Draft found.
"These reports failed to highlight the fact that the vaccine was approved before it had gone through large-scale Phase 3 trials, which provoked widespread concern and objections from the scientific community."
Conversely, in some cases, an oversupply of information was to blame for a lack of clarity among the social media posts examined, such as in the case of the frantic reporting on vaccine trials and the "race" to secure the first effective jab.
According to the researchers, much of this reporting did not contextualise the "race" or seek to make sense of it, with much of it based solely on press releases from pharmaceutical companies and thus subject to so-called "pharma-spin".
"This deluge of reporting ― much of which may be biased toward the interests of pharmaceutical companies ― leaves many more questions than answers, creating more spaces vulnerable to speculation and misinformation."
With coronavirus cases nearing 10 million and deaths topping 139,000, India, like the rest of the world, faces a battle not just with COVID-19, but with the infodemic of misinformation related to the virus.
"Ashok Gehlot, a prominent figure in India's main opposition Indian National Congress party, announced in early November 2020 that Rajasthan would ban the use of firecrackers in Diwali celebrations in a bid to limit air pollution during the COVID-19 pandemic," the fact checkers said.
A widely shared photo of Mr Gehlot burning firecrackers, however, was taken in October 2019, before the pandemic and before the fireworks were banned, AFP said.
The Government's resourcing of the ANAO, when adjusted for inflation, was 14.34 per cent lower in 2019-20 than in Labor's final budget.
When considered as a share of overall government expenditure, there is an even clearer trend of dwindling resourcing of the ANAO's budget against increased public spending.
While in 2001, government resourcing of the ANAO accounted for 0.02761 per cent of overall expenditure, by 2019-20 this figure had fallen to 0.01303 per cent ― a drop of 47.19 per cent.
If the ANAO's budget is funded as planned in 2020-21, this figure would decline even further to 0.01108 per cent, representing a drop of 60 per cent since 2000-01.
But Fact Check found Labor to not be absolved of all responsibility either, with government resourcing of the ANAO beginning its decline in real terms under a previous Labor government.
It began with a trickle that many feared would become a tsunami. 
Canberra silversmith Marissa Ziesing was so afraid of being part of that wave of infection that she delayed going to hospital even when her fever broke 40 degrees Celsius. The 35-year-old had been sick with a cough and temperature for six days but had already returned a negative test for COVID-19. 
"I was calling the nurse helpline and they were saying to call an ambulance, but I didn't," she says.
"It sounds really dramatic but at the time they were saying that Australia was going to be like Italy [where hospitals were overwhelmed] … I was just really worried about wasting tests and wasting resources and putting anyone at risk."
So Marissa stayed put for another night in her friend's spare room where she was quarantining after returning to Australia from her adopted home in London.
The next day, Marissa was hospitalised with COVID-19. Her earlier test had been a false negative.
"I wasn't ventilated but I was on oxygen. I had issues with my heart and kidney and liver … I was really scared," she says.
It was March 30. The virus had already killed more than 39,600 people worldwide. Ten months later, another 2 million would be dead.
One of the most terrifying aspects of contracting COVID-19 so early in the pandemic was how little the world knew about the disease, Marissa says.
"The doctors were telling me how they were reading about it, saying, 'Well, from what we've read about what you're saying …' because that's all they had to go on."
Marissa is among the hundreds who responded to an ABC survey about how the pandemic has affected Australians.
Returned travellers like Marissa make up two-thirds of the nearly 6,800 people diagnosed with coronavirus during the first wave of infections in Australia.
But these figures should be taken with a grain of salt, says Deakin University chair in epidemiology Catherine Bennett. 
During the first wave in March and April, Australia's limited testing capacity meant the protocol targeted returned travellers.
"You're only going to find [positive cases] in the people you're testing … We actively did not measure community transmission, even if you had symptoms," she says.
This means Australia's first-wave case numbers underestimate not only the true number of infections but, more specifically, locally spread infections. 
"The first wave was bigger than we will ever know," Professor Bennett says.
"But lockdown did its job and ultimately stopped that [variant] completely."
The second wave, however, would prove a far tougher beast.
The strain of the virus circulating in Australia during the first wave had all but petered out by the time a family of four returned travellers was transferred to Melbourne's Rydges on Swanston hotel.
It was May 15 and two members had been diagnosed with COVID-19. The remaining two would test positive a few days later. 
Even though they were in quarantine, security guards allowed the family out of their room for walks through common areas of the hotel, which may have been how the virus was transmitted.
Within a week, the family had infected two security guards and a hotel worker. By June 18, the cluster had swelled to 17.
Meanwhile, across town at the Stamford Plaza, a single man diagnosed with COVID-19 on June 4 and a couple diagnosed on June 15 and 16 became the origin of a second quarantine hotel cluster, this one numbering 46 cases.
Genomic testing would later trace 99 per cent of second-wave cases to these two quarantine hotel breaches. Roughly 90 per cent were linked to the Rydges hotel, with the remainder linked to the Stamford.
"The Stamford variant was a precursor to the current [more infectious] UK strain … so the one that should have been, if anything, more infectious, actually got shut down quite quickly," Professor Bennett says. 
The Rydges variant took a wildly different turn. It seeded thousands of infections, killed hundreds and triggered one of the longest and toughest lockdowns in the world.
"We did get to zero [cases] but … no-one would say 111 days of lockdown is a success story," Professor Bennett says.
"The question has to be asked: Did we work as well as we could have, as quickly as we could have … given the high cost to life and health?" 
The catastrophic second wave erupted from the convergence of two fault lines: one from nature, the other man-made.
"[Melbourne] had to have an incredibly long lockdown … because the virus was just constantly being re-seeded back into the community," Professor Bennett says.
"But in parallel, we also discovered the cracks in our contact tracing system."
Contact tracing is one of the most critical elements of infection control, according to epidemiologist and UNSW professor of global biosecurity Raina MacIntyre. 
A single positive case may have 10 to 20 contacts, she says. If there are 100 new cases a day, contact tracers must track down 1,000 to 2,000 contacts within 24 hours.
"That means that during the Victorian second wave, at any one time they might have had 200,000 to 500,000 people in quarantine who needed to be monitored daily," Professor MacIntyre says.
"And on top of that, they had to identify all the new contacts that occurred each day."
It is a mammoth task. The system was simply overwhelmed.
"Early on in the pandemic … there was a good recognition that we needed more hospital beds, more ventilators, more ICU beds ― and bang, it was all done. By March, we'd expanded ICU capacity more than 100 per cent," Professor MacIntyre says.
"But nobody recognised the need for surge capacity in the public health system, which is responsible for contact tracing and outbreak investigation."
The consequences would be dire.
The dynamic of Victoria's second wave was completely different to the first wave, according to experts.
During the first wave, the biggest outbreaks were linked to returned travellers, particularly those who had been on cruise ships such as the Ruby Princess, which engendered a cluster of more than 850 crew and passengers.
Victoria's second wave, however, "was all community transmission", Professor MacIntyre says. 
"That's much, much harder to control … Shutting down a border is not going to fix that."
In the second wave, the virus spread from hotel quarantine to homes, between neighbours and across work sites.
Essential workers, many of whom were casually employed at multiple workplaces, bore the brunt of its fury as nursing homes, schools, hospitals, meatworks and supply distribution centres became the centre of the second wave. 
"[They were] the very places that you can't shut down, even in the strictest of lockdowns," Professor Bennett says.
"It led to a really rapid escalation in case numbers … [and] multiple spreader events, particularly in that north-west corridor in Melbourne.
"It was these people's families, their workplaces, their schools, their nursing homes, primarily … They were the hardest hit."
As the virus cut a swathe through the city, young workers were also swept up, with people in their 20s recording the highest number of diagnoses of any age group. 
"There was a lot of, 'Oh, look, all these young adults are still spreading the virus' and somehow it was all about partying," Doherty Institute professor Jodie McVernon says.
"But who was working in the supermarkets and the hospitals? Who was delivering your groceries and takeaway meals? They were the people actually out there, even in lockdown, working at the front line."
From workplaces, it seeped into homes. At the public housing towers in North Melbourne and Flemington, the number of infections soared more than 10-fold in a month, from 28 to 310.
High-rise buildings with shared amenities, crowded units and a vulnerable population, the towers were a tinderbox for the disease.
"If you are four people living in a four-bedroom, two-bathroom house, it's going to be much easier to isolate yourselves from each other than if you are 10 people living in a two-bedroom, one-bathroom unit," Professor McVernon says.
"There were a lot of shared facilities and common spaces like laundries and stairwells where people from many, many households would congregate very close together.
"And there were also quite a lot of elderly people living alone in those towers who were more vulnerable to severe outcomes."
Data showing the percentage of local- versus overseas-spread infections tells the story.
In Victoria, overseas cases plummeted from 63 per cent of confirmed cases at the peak of the first wave to just 5 per cent.
This compares with 89 per cent in WA, 76 per cent in Queensland and 57 per cent in NSW.
Even starker are the figures at local council level. 
Among Victorian councils with more than 500 confirmed cases, the share of local infections climbs as high as 99 per cent in the blue-collar areas of Brimbank and Wyndham. 
Brimbank battled three major meatworks outbreaks ― Cedar Meats, JBS Abattoir and Somerville Retail Services. Wyndham is home to Al-Taqwa College, where infections climbed past 200, and some of the deadliest nursing home clusters, including Baptcare Wyndham Lodge and Glendale.
In NSW, the rate of local transmission has been lower across the board. 
Among councils with more than 50 confirmed cases, the western Sydney suburb of Fairfield, home to the Thai Rock restaurant cluster, has the highest share of locally spread transmissions, at 84 per cent.
It is followed by Liverpool, location of the Crossroads Hotel, at 73 per cent.
According to Professor Bennett, "the whole thing could have ended six weeks earlier" had we understood that the second wave was driven by transmission across essential industries and had Victoria's contact tracing been up to the task.
But even under stage four restrictions, Melburnians were allowed to leave the house for work.
"We kept tightening up the community lockdown ... and that's the part I still think wasn't the answer," she says.
"Clearly, as we learned in the second wave, lockdown doesn't work against workplace outbreaks among essential workers."
When Susie's mother became the first aged care resident to die with coronavirus, no-one ― not even the doctors ― knew her mother had the disease.
Judy, as she was fondly known to her family, was a resident at BaptistCare's Dorothy Henderson Lodge, in Sydney's north-west. 
The nursing home became the centre of Australia's first locally spread cluster in March.
A former pianist and piano teacher, Judy loved to read the newspaper and tried to instil in her children the value of behaving "properly" and having good table manners, Susie says.
"Mum always used to say that when she was a bit upset or angry, she'd go and sit at the piano and after an hour everything would be fine."
Judy, 94, was taken to hospital with a cough and suspected pneumonia but wasn't tested for COVID-19 until after she had passed away on March 3.
"There was no mention of COVID, no safety precautions, nothing … The hospital advised us to gather the close family for final goodbyes. The nursing home had asked us to give her a big kiss from them," Susie says.
"I was holding her hand when she died … You just think, well, that wouldn't happen now, not with everything we know [about the disease]."
Three of the six family members who were with Judy when she died also contracted the virus.
It was later revealed that a carer at the home was diagnosed with COVID-19 on the day Judy died. Within five weeks, the cluster had expanded to five staff and 17 residents, six of whom died.
"We still don't really know what happened," Susie says.
"We were never told whether that carer had attended to Mum or not. They [Dorothy Henderson] didn't talk to us again for a very long time … We were just sort of left out in the cold."
A BaptistCare spokesperson told the ABC their staff "worked very hard in cooperation with health authorities to contain the outbreak, which was certainly challenging in those early days of the pandemic".
"Even now, we are seeing health authorities globally continuing to learn and adapt their responses to the challenges presented by the virus."

Judy's family was the first of hundreds whose loved ones in aged care would die with coronavirus.
Throughout March, Australia's cumulative case count doubled every three to four days, surging from less than 30 diagnosed cases on March 1 to 4,500 within a month.
By the peak of the first wave, active cases outnumbered recoveries by more than 15:1.
By the end of the first wave, 103 people had died, including 30 in aged care.
By mid-June, daily new cases had fallen to single digits and recoveries outnumbered active cases by 16:1.
There were no active cases in aged care.
It was the calm before the storm.
On July 30, as the second wave began to crest, new cases hit a record high of 746 in a single day.
By the end of August, aged care residents and staff made up two-thirds of the nation's active cases. 
At some facilities, outbreaks simmered for more than three months.
By December, one-third of infected aged care residents had died.
Aged care residents, including those receiving in-home care, make up 15 per cent of Australia's confirmed cases but 75 per cent of deaths.
At least 5,078 of some 18,700 second-wave infections in Victoria ― more than one in four ― are linked to aged care, according to the data published by Victoria's Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) on January 22. 
Among the aged care cases, just under 40 per cent are residents, 38 per cent are staff and about 23 per cent are other linked cases such as household contacts, spanning some 70 facilities. The data only includes aged care homes with five or more confirmed cases. 
The tragedy was not unforeseeable. Nursing homes are "an incubator for outbreaks", Professor MacIntyre says.
"We've had experience with aged care outbreaks for decades and decades. We know that aged care is at high risk for big outbreaks of things like flu and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) and gastroenteritis.
"There's a lot of vulnerable people living in close proximity, staff coming and going, and moving between residents."
Doherty Institute's Professor McVernon said the tragedy that had played out in nursing homes reflected "something about our society … and what we invest in aged care".
"In Switzerland, where they've had very, very high rates of infection, they've had very low rates of outbreaks in aged care," she said.
"And in Switzerland, once you put your loved ones in aged care, you will not have an inheritance but they will have a very comfortable life. So I think you get what you pay for."
More than 28,500 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in Australia since the first cases were confirmed a year ago.
No doubt the tally will continue to rise. The question is: how quickly?
Professor MacIntyre warns that Australia's "stubborn refusal" to recognise the role of airborne transmission in the spread of coronavirus is "absolutely a flashpoint".
"Australia has been one of the last countries to acknowledge airborne transmission as a major way that the virus spreads," she says.
"Even the WHO and the US, which were denying it at the beginning, are now acknowledging that it's important ― particularly indoors."
Recognising the role of airborne transmission would allow Australia to address two critical weaknesses that continue to threaten health and safety, she says. The first is respiratory protection, particularly for workers in quarantine settings, and the second is ventilation, which is especially problematic in high-rise buildings.
But Australia has the advantage of two vital weapons in our fight against the disease, Professor Vernon says.
"Political will and the public. Without those things, it doesn't matter what the expert advice is. It doesn't matter what the armoury of vaccines or medicines or anything else is," she says.
"If the public doesn't go along with the advice, if they don't present for testing, if they don't change their behaviours, if they don't participate ... you can't go anywhere."
Canberra silversmith Marissa Ziesing ended up being hospitalised for seven days. She is still recovering, physically and mentally.
"The only thing I'd had before [COVID-19] was low blood pressure … Even now my chest is not the same," she says.
"I have lung issues and I get these sort of heart flutters. I lost hair as well. Like, two months afterwards, my hair all started falling out … I think from the shock to the body. And I still have days where I just hit the couch."
But between the tears, the heartache and the sheer exhaustion, Marissa has found joy in reconnecting with family and friends from her childhood city. She says she doesn't regret being back.
It's a sentiment everyone in Australia should share, Professor MacIntyre says. 
"We are all very fortunate to have had the random chance of being born here or migrating here or just being here [during the pandemic]," she says.
"I think we need to think about that ― about what kind of suffering and catastrophes are going on outside of our borders ― and be grateful."
